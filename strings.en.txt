Experience
Mass Surveillance
We live in an era of mass data collection, undermining of civil security technologies and off the shelf surveillance tools for national agents. What does this mean for us?
Privacy & anonymity
Technological and cultural shift to producing, sharing and gathering enornmous ammounds of data privacy and anonymity seem dead. Are they?
Metadata
Metadata tells more about you, because contrary to content, it just doesn't lie. Why is that?
Cryptography
How can cryptography help to achieve confidentiality in journalistic cooperation with sources?
Stop leaving so many trails
Learn to notice your digital shadow, and  to make it smaller.
Harden communication channels

Hide in the crowd
Anonymity is not simply about being unknown. It's also about being in a crowd you don't stand out from.
