About The Soundmapping
The aim of the project is to create simple and modern web-based tool for archiving and preserving oral cultural heritage. It will be archived as series of radio documentaries where main characters are witnesses of unique, phenomenas specific to the participating regions. These documentaries will be geographically located on an interactive map that will be main part of the website. Project will be carried out in the cities of Krakow, Budapest and Bratislava and for each of the cities an online based archive in the form of sound map will be created. The archives will contain interviews with locals, stories, urban legends, myths and unique city sounds as well as accompanying archival
					records.
